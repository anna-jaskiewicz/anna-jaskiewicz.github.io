I conduct two separate but complementary studies that document the adverse impact of local anti-Black hate crimes on the health outcomes of Black infants and adults. I show that anti-Black aggravated assaults in one's area of residence are associated with lower birth weights and shorter gestation lengths among Black infants as well as an increased volume of chest pain-related Emergency Department visits among Black adults. Effects on White infants and adults are negligible in magnitude and to a large extent insignificant. These findings indicate that anti-Black hate crimes are a substantial stressor for Black Americans, potentially contributing to the Black-White health gap present in the United States.
