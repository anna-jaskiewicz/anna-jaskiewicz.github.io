Procrastination is a common occurrence in everyday life, particularly among students. In this paper, we explore the implementation of a gamified leaderboard within an undergraduate economics course to assess its impact on class engagement and procrastination reduction. The leaderboard is integrated within weekly online assignments, auto-graded using an AI-assisted platform. Students achieving a full score and submitting their work earlier are ranked higher on the leaderboard. Our preliminary results suggest that the treated group, i.e., the group exposed to the leaderboard, spends significantly less time on assignments and exhibits earlier completion times relative to the control group. i.e., the group not exposed to the leaderboard. This points to the positive influence of gamified leaderboards on reducing procrastination tendencies and motivating students to complete tasks earlier.
