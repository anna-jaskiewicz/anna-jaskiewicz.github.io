Procrastination is a common occurrence in everyday life, particularly among students. In this paper, we explore the implementation of a gamified leaderboard within an undergraduate economics course to assess its impact on class engagement and procrastination reduction. By investigating the effects of this gamified leaderboard in an undergraduate economics class, we aim to contribute to the ongoing research on student engagement and procrastination reduction. The findings of this study have the potential to inform educational practices and strategies that can effectively enhance student motivation, participation, and ultimately, academic performance.
