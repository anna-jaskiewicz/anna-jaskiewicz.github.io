**About me**

I am a PhD candidate in the Economics Department and a Graduate Associate at the Broom Center for Demography at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My current research centers on how exposure to local crime impacts health outcomes for marginalized communities. In my job market paper, I study if and how anti-Black hate crimes exacerbate Black-White health disparities. I find that exposure to local anti-Black hate crimes adversely affects health outcomes of Black (but not White) individuals across the life course. I have presented this work at major disciplinary conferences (e.g. the Population Association of America Annual Meeting and the American Society of Health Economists Conference). 

I have served as an Instructor of Record for five quarters and as a Head Teaching Assistant for seven quarters, managing teams of up to 12 Teaching Assistants and guiding cohorts of up to 700 students. My dedication to teaching has also been acknowledged through my receipt of the Departmental Outstanding Undergraduate TA Award three times over five years.

Before attending UCSB, I received a BA in Economics (summa cum laude) from New York University in Shanghai.
