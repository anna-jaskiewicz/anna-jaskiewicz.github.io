**About me**

I am a PhD candidate in the Economics Department and a Graduate Associate at the Broom Center for Demography at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My current research centers on how exposure to local crime impacts health outcomes for marginalized communities. 

In my job market paper, I study if and how anti-Black hate crimes exacerbate Black-White disparities in health. I find that exposure to local anti-Black hate crimes negatively impacts health outcomes of Black (but not White) individuals and I detect these adverse effects at various stages of the life course, from infancy to adulthood. I have presented this work at major disciplinary conferences, including the Annual Meeting of the Population Association of America and the Annual Conference of the American Society of Health Economists. 

I have served as an Instructor of Record for five quarters and as a Head Teaching Assistant for seven quarters, managing teams of up to 17 Teaching Assistants and guiding cohorts of over 700 students. My dedication to teaching has been acknowledged through my receipt of the Departmental Outstanding Undergraduate TA Award three times over the past five years.

Before attending UCSB, I received a BA in Economics (summa cum laude) from New York University in Shanghai.
