I designed an original, undergraduate-level summer course discussing the social scientific scholarship on the status and origins of health inequities in the United States. I evaluated applications for the course, selecting a cohort of 30 students. I also recruited, designed ASE contracts for, and coordinated a team of two Teaching Assistants. Throughout the course, I mentored student groups working on empirical research projects related to health disparities.
