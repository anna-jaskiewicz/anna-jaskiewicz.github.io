I coordinated a team of up to 17 Teaching Assistants, serving over 700 students. I facilitated the switch to remote learning during COVID-19 pandemic (set up Zoom discussion sections and office hours, implemented online assignments and exams). I created grading rubrics and led exam grading sessions to ensure inter-grader consistency. I also facilitated the transition from ParScore to GradeScope for grading of multiple-choice exam questions. Lastly, I set up and administered Moodle and Canvas course pages as well as managed email communication with students.
