I prepared course materials (pre-recorded online lecture videos using Panopto, homework assignments) for a new course in introductory statistics, together with 3 graduate student colleagues and a faculty supervisor. I moderated interactive, in-person lecture activities for up to 50 students and led in-person review sessions for up to 600 students. I also created multiple-choice and open-response exam questions and proctored in-person exams with up to 600 students. Finally, I collaborated with Disabled Student Program (DSP) advisors to ensure appropriate accommodations for DSP students.
